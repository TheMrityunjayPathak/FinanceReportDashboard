**Financial Analysis Report**

Hello Everyone, 👋

I made this Finance Report in PowerBI with the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft on their Website.

📝 Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like :

1️⃣ Report Data can be sliced by Segement, Country and Year to show Particular Data.

2️⃣ It has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale and Total Profit.

3️⃣ It has a Clustered Bar Chart with Year on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing Profit Quaterly.

4️⃣ And Lastly, It has a Area Chart showing Months on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing profit Monthly.

I have also included a 🔄 Reset Button at the Top to clear all Slicer's.

To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset the Slicer's.
