## Finance Report Dashboard

Hello Everyone,

I made this Finance Dashboard in Power BI with the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft on their Website.

## Problem Statement

- The goal of this Power BI Dashboard Project is to analyze the financial performance of a company using the provided Microsoft Sample Data.

- To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

## Sections in the Report

**Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like :**

- Report Data can be sliced by Segments, Country and Year to show Particular Data.

- It has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale and Total Profit.

- It has a Clustered Bar Chart with Year on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing Profit Quarterly.

- And Lastly, It has a Area Chart showing Months on X-Axis and Profit on Y-Axis showing profit Monthly.

- I have also included a 🔄 Reset Button at the Top to clear all Slicer's.

- To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset the Slicer's.

## Getting Started
