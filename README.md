## Finance Report Dashboard

Hello Everyone, 

I made this Finance Dashboard in Power BI with the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft on their Website.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this Power BI Dashboard is to analyze the financial performance of a company using the provided Microsoft Sample Data.

To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

## Sections in the Report

**Report has multiple section's from where you can manage the data, like :**

- Report data can be sliced by Segments, Country and Year to show particular data.

- Report has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale and Total Profit.

- Report has a clustered bar chart with year on x-axis and profit on y-axis showing profit quarterly.

- And lastly, Report has a area chart showing months on x-axis and profit on y-axis showing profit monthly.

- I have also included a **Reset** button at the top to clear all slicer's.

- To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset all the slicer's.
